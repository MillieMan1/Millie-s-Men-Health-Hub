    <p id="color-ofparagraph">Many people don't understand why or how other people become addicted to drugs.<br> 
They may mistakenly think that those who use drugs lack moral principles or willpower and that they<br>
could stop their drug use simply by choosing to. In reality, drug addiction is a complex disease,<br>
and quitting usually takes more than good intentions or a strong will. Drugs change the brain in <br>
ways that make quitting hard, even for those who want to. Fortunately, researchers know more than <br>
ever about how drugs affect the brain and have found treatments that can help people recover from <br>
 drug addiction and lead productive lives. </p>

    <h2>What is a Drug Addication?</h2>
    <p id="color-ofparagraph">
        Addiction is a chronic disease characterized by drug seeking and use that<br>
        is compulsive, or difficult to control, despite harmful consequences. The initial decision to take drugs <br>
        is voluntary for most people, but repeated drug use can lead to brain changes that challenge an addicted person’s<br> 
        self-control and interfere with their ability to resist intense urges to take drugs. These brain changes can be<br> 
        persistent, which is why drug addiction is considered a "relapsing" disease—people in recovery from drug use disorders <br>
        are at increased risk for returning to drug use even after years of not taking the drug. <br>
    </p>
    <P id="color-ofparagraph">
       It's common for a person to relapse, but relapse doesn't mean that treatment doesn’t work.<br>
       As with other chronic health conditions, treatment should be ongoing and should be adjusted<br>
       based on how the patient responds. Treatment plans need to be reviewed often and modified to <br>
       fit the patient’s changing needs.

        <h2>What happens to the brain when a person takes drugs?</h2>
        <p id="color-ofparagraph">Most drugs affect the brain's "reward circuit" by flooding it with the chemical messenger dopamine.<br> 
        This reward system controls the body's ability to feel pleasure and motivates a person to repeat behaviors <br> 
        needed to thrive, such as eating and spending time with loved ones. This overstimulation of the reward <br> 
        circuit causes the intensely pleasurable "high" that can lead people to take a drug again and again. </p>
       
        <p id="color-ofparagraph">As a person continues to use drugs, the brain adjusts to the excess dopamine by making less of it and/or<br> 
        reducing the ability of cells in the reward circuit to respond to it. This reduces the high that the person<br>
        feels compared to the high they felt when first taking the drug—an effect known as tolerance. They might take <br>
        more of the drug, trying to achieve the same dopamine high. It can also cause them to get less pleasure from <br>
        other things they once enjoyed, like food or social activities. </p>
        
        <p id="color-ofparagraph">Long-term use also causes changes in other brain chemical systems and circuits as well, affecting functions that include: 
<ul id="listone">
    <li>learning</li> 
    <li>judgment</li> 
    <li>decision-making</li> 
    <li>stress</li> 
    <li>memory</li> 
    <li>behavior</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="color-ofparagraph">Despite being aware of these harmful outcomes, many people who use drugs continue to take them, which is the nature of addiction. </p>
